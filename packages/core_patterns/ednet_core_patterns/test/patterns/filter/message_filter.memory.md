# Message Filter Pattern - Memory File

## Pattern Overview

The Message Filter pattern selectively processes messages based on specific criteria, allowing components to receive only relevant messages while discarding others. In the digital democracy platform context, it:

- Creates topic-specific discussion threads for focused citizen deliberation
- Routes messages to appropriate regional/jurisdictional forums
- Personalizes the democratic experience based on citizen interests
- Enables multilingual participation across language barriers
- Maintains civil discourse through content moderation

## EDNet Core Integration

When implementing a pattern in EDNet Core:

1. **Domain Model Integration**:
   - The filter pattern is modeled with source and target channels
   - Each filter type (predicate, selector, composite) has distinct semantic meaning
   - Filtering statistics provide transparency for democratic oversight

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Tests demonstrate concrete democratic use cases
   - The mock domain model evolves to support richer democratic scenarios
   - Each test represents a specific civic participation scenario

3. **Documentation**:
   - Each component is documented with its role in democratic processes
   - Examples showcase real citizen participation scenarios
   - Semantic meaning is tied to direct democracy principles

## Implementation Structure

## Democratic Use Cases

1. **Topic Filters**:
   - Housing policy discussions for affordable housing initiatives
   - Environmental deliberation channels for sustainability proposals
   - Transportation forums for mobility infrastructure planning
   - Healthcare discussions for public health policies

2. **Regional Filters**:
   - Local district-specific governance discussions
   - Municipal vs. regional vs. national policy separation
   - Neighborhood-level citizen engagement
   - Cross-border cooperation on shared resources

3. **Composite Filters**:
   - Youth council for environmental initiatives (topic AND demographic)
   - Emergency response discussions during crises (topic AND priority)
   - Special interest combinations (housing AND transportation)
   - Targeted citizen engagement (region AND interest)

4. **Language Filters**:
   - Multilingual democratic participation
   - Translation services for cross-cultural deliberation
   - Native language policy discussions
   - Inclusive communication across linguistic barriers

5. **Moderation Filters**:
   - Civil discourse maintenance
   - Community standards enforcement
   - Safe participation environment
   - Democratic integrity protection

## Testing Scenarios

Each test models a specific democratic scenario:
- Topic-based citizen discussion routing
- Regional governance message distribution
- Multilingual democratic participation
- Civil discourse moderation
- Lifecycle management for democratic integrity

## Implementation Hierarchy

- **TestMessageFilter**: Base interface for all filters
- **TestPredicateFilter**: Simple condition-based filtering
- **TestSelectorFilter**: Value extraction and comparison
- **TestCompositeFilter**: Logical operations on multiple conditions

## Remember

- Reuse the same mock domain model structure across patterns
- Focus on digital democracy use cases and semantics
- Document the democratic significance of each component
- Build tests that demonstrate civic participation scenarios
