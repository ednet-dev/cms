# Channel Adapter Pattern - Memory File

## Pattern Overview

The Channel Adapter pattern connects applications to messaging channels, translating application-specific messages to a canonical messaging format. In the digital democracy platform context, it:

- Connects citizen-facing apps to the core democracy infrastructure
- Integrates legacy government systems via standardized messaging
- Enables secure cross-boundary voting and deliberation
- Supports multilingual/multicultural democratic participation

## EDNet Core Integration

When implementing a pattern in EDNet Core:

1. **Domain Model Integration**:
   - Patterns should be represented as proper domain models
   - Use `Entity`, `ValueObject`, and `Concept` from EDNet Core

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Create a simplified test adapter that doesn't rely on complex domain model connections
   - Use the full domain model in production code

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document each component with its democratic context
   - Explain how each adapter facilitates democratic participation
   - Use examples that reflect civic engagement scenarios

## Democratic Use Cases

1. **HTTP Adapter**:
   - Voter registration and identity verification
   - Secure ballot submission to counting systems
   - Integration with government document repositories
   - Open data portal access for transparency

2. **WebSocket Adapter**:
   - Real-time deliberation participation
   - Live voting results broadcasting
   - Town hall streaming and participation
   - Instant democratic notification delivery

## Test Scenarios

- Authentication requests from citizens
- Vote confirmation responses
- Real-time deliberation participation
- Configuration for different jurisdictions

## Remember

- Document democratic context for all components
- Follow EDNet Core instantiation chain
- Explain semantic meaning in direct democracy context
- Adapters bridge civic participation across system boundaries
