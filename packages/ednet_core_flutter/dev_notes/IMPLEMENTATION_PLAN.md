# EDNet Shell Interpreter - Implementation Plan

This document outlines our implementation approach for the EDNet Shell Interpreter, following a strict TDD methodology for each component.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

### Components to Implement

#### Core Domain Model Interpretation

1. **DomainMetadataInterpreter**
   - **Purpose**: Load and cache domain model metadata from EDNet Core
   - **Test Approach**: Test with mock domain models of varying complexity
   - **Implementation Goal**: Extract all relevant metadata (concepts, attributes, relationships)

2. **ConceptUIMapper**
   - **Purpose**: Map domain concepts to UI representations
   - **Test Approach**: Verify correct mapping of attributes to UI field types
   - **Implementation Goal**: Support all standard attribute types (string, number, date, boolean, etc.)

#### UI Generation Components

1. **ListViewGenerator**
   - **Purpose**: Generate list views for domain concepts
   - **Test Approach**: Test list generation with mock concepts
   - **Implementation Goal**: Basic list with configurable fields and actions

2. **DetailViewGenerator**
   - **Purpose**: Generate detail views for entity instances
   - **Test Approach**: Test detail view construction with mock entities
   - **Implementation Goal**: Complete detail view with all attributes and relationships

3. **FormBuilder**
   - **Purpose**: Generate forms for entity creation/editing
   - **Test Approach**: Test form validation against domain rules
   - **Implementation Goal**: Fully functional form with validation

## Phase 2: Navigation & State (Weeks 4-6)

### Components to Implement

1. **NavigationService**
   - **Purpose**: Handle navigation between domain entities and screens
   - **Test Approach**: Test navigation paths and state tracking
   - **Implementation Goal**: Support master-detail and hierarchical navigation

2. **BreadcrumbManager**
   - **Purpose**: Generate breadcrumbs based on domain relationships
   - **Test Approach**: Test breadcrumb generation with nested relationships
   - **Implementation Goal**: Accurate breadcrumbs for any depth of navigation

3. **CommandDispatcher**
   - **Purpose**: Issue domain commands from UI actions
   - **Test Approach**: Test command creation and dispatch with mocks
   - **Implementation Goal**: Support all command types with proper feedback

4. **EventSubscriber**
   - **Purpose**: Listen for domain events and update UI
   - **Test Approach**: Test event handling and UI updates
   - **Implementation Goal**: Real-time UI updates based on domain events

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-9)

### Components to Implement

1. **PolicyEvaluator**
   - **Purpose**: Check user permissions for UI actions
   - **Test Approach**: Test with various role/policy combinations
   - **Implementation Goal**: Hide/show UI elements based on permissions

2. **ThemeManager**
   - **Purpose**: Apply consistent theming to shell components
   - **Test Approach**: Test theme application across components
   - **Implementation Goal**: Support EDNet Shell Theme System
   - **Theme Components**:
     - CheerfulThemeComponent: Vibrant, colorful theme with strong hierarchy
     - CLIThemeComponent: Monospace-focused theme inspired by terminal interfaces
     - MinimalisticThemeComponent: Clean theme with reduced visual noise

3. **PluginRegistry**
   - **Purpose**: Allow registration of custom components
   - **Test Approach**: Test component overrides and extensions
   - **Implementation Goal**: Flexible component substitution

4. **DisclosureManager**
   - **Purpose**: Control UI complexity level
   - **Test Approach**: Test UI adaptation at different levels
   - **Implementation Goal**: Support all standard disclosure levels

## Theme System Implementation

The EDNet Shell Architecture Theme System provides progressive disclosure UI patterns and semantic styling based on domain model concepts.

### Theme Features

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Eight disclosure levels: minimal, basic, standard, intermediate, advanced, detailed, complete, debug
   - Theme adjustments based on disclosure level (colors, typography, spacing)

2. **Semantic Styling**
   - Distinct visual treatments for entities, concepts, attributes, relationships
   - Consistent styling across the application based on domain semantics

3. **Theme Extensions**
   - ThemeExtensions: Custom theme data through Flutter's ThemeExtension system
   - DisclosureLevelThemeExtension: Customized appearance per disclosure level
   - SemanticColorsExtension: Colors defined for domain concepts

### Theme Migration Status

#### Completed Components

- âœ… `src/ui/theme/theme_constants.dart`
- âœ… `src/ui/theme/text_styles.dart`
- âœ… `src/ui/theme/theme.dart`
- âœ… `src/ui/theme/theme_service.dart`
- âœ… `src/ui/theme/components/theme_component.dart`
- âœ… `src/ui/theme/extensions/theme_extensions.dart`
- âœ… `src/ui/theme/extensions/theme_spacing.dart`
- âœ… `src/ui/theme/extensions/disclosure_level_theme_extension.dart`
- âœ… `src/ui/theme/extensions/semantic_colors_extension.dart`

#### In Progress Components

- ðŸ”„ `src/ui/theme/components/cheerful_theme_component.dart`

#### Pending Components

- âŒ› `src/ui/theme/components/cli_theme_component.dart`
- âŒ› `src/ui/theme/components/minimalistic_theme_component.dart`
- âŒ› `src/ui/theme/components/custom_colors.dart`
- âŒ› `src/ui/theme/components/list_item_card.dart`

- âŒ› `src/ui/theme/strategy/standard_theme_strategy.dart`
- âŒ› `src/ui/theme/providers/theme_provider.dart`

### Implementation Tasks

#### Fixed Issues

- âœ… Added required imports and part directives to barrel file
- âœ… Created theme spacing extensions with disclosure level support
- âœ… Created theme context extensions with semantic concept awareness
- âœ… Created disclosure level theme extension
- âœ… Created semantic colors extension
- âœ… Fixed linting errors in theme extensions

#### Remaining Tasks

1. Complete CheerfulThemeComponent migration with proper disclosure level integration
2. Implement remaining theme components (CLI, Minimalistic, Custom Colors, ListItemCard)
3. Implement theme strategy and connect with UX Adapters
4. Create theme provider with Configuration Injector integration
5. Implement UX Channel for theme changes

### Architecture Integration

1. **Progressive Disclosure System**: Theme adapts based on disclosure level
2. **Configuration Injection**: Theme configuration via Configuration system
3. **UX Adaptation**: Custom styling for domain entities and concepts
4. **Message-based Architecture**: Theme changes propagate through UX Channel

### Testing Strategy

1. **Component Tests**: Test theme components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify disclosure level changes affect appearance
3. **Visual Regression Tests**: Capture screenshots to detect unexpected changes

## TDD Implementation Workflow

For each component, we will:

1. **Create Test File**: Write comprehensive tests for the component
2. **Implement RED Phase**: Ensure tests fail with clear error messages
3. **Implement GREEN Phase**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
4. **Implement REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality and performance
5. **Document**: Update SHELL_TDD.md with progress and decisions

## Integration Testing

After individual components pass their unit tests, we will:

1. **Create Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
2. **Implement Sample Applications**: Build example apps using the Shell Interpreter
3. **Performance Testing**: Evaluate performance with large domain models

## Review Process

1. **Code Review**: Each component undergoes peer review after passing tests
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure documentation matches implementation
3. **Architecture Review**: Evaluate architectural decisions and patterns

## Deliverables

1. **Component Library**: Complete Shell Interpreter library
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive API docs and usage guides
3. **Example Applications**: Sample apps demonstrating key features
4. **Test Suite**: Full unit and integration test coverage
