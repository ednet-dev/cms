# Master-Detail Navigation Prototype for EDNet Core Flutter

## Current Status: Prototype Implementation

We've created a prototype implementation of a master-detail navigation pattern for the EDNet Core Flutter shell app. This implementation:

1. Provides a hierarchical left-to-right navigation flow for domain models
2. Integrates constraint validation for entity attributes
3. Implements breadcrumb navigation for context awareness
4. Shifts UI focus as users navigate deeper into relationships

## Known Issues

The current implementation has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Type Mismatches**: The classes used in the prototype don't match the actual class definitions in the ednet_core library
2. **Flutter Imports**: The code references Flutter widgets but doesn't properly import the Flutter packages
3. **Relationship Navigation**: The implementation for navigating relations is incomplete
4. **Testing Gaps**: No tests have been written for the new components

## Implementation Plan

To complete this feature, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Domain Classes**: Examine the actual class structure in ednet_core to match our implementation
   - Understand the Domain, Model, Concept, and Entity class hierarchy
   - Identify how relationships are represented between entities
   - Check how AttributeType and constraints are implemented

2. **Update MasterDetailNavigator**:
   - Fix class references to match actual ednet_core classes
   - Implement proper entity loading and relationship traversal
   - Ensure constraint validation works with the actual AttributeType implementation

3. **Create Integration Example**:
   - Update the shell_app_with_master_detail.dart with correct class usage
   - Create a small sample domain model for demonstration
   - Implement proper data loading and state management

4. **Add Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for navigation logic
   - Add widget tests for UI components
   - Test constraint validation integration

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation with real-world usage examples
   - Document integration patterns with existing code
   - Create user guide for implementing custom adapters

## Integration with Existing Architecture

The master-detail navigator should integrate with these existing components:

1. **ShellApp**: The central coordinator that provides domain model access
2. **ConstraintValidatedForm**: Form component that validates based on domain model constraints
3. **LayoutAdapterRegistry**: Registry for custom entity visualizations
4. **BreadcrumbService**: Service for tracking navigation history
5. **DisclosureLevel**: System for progressive disclosure of UI elements

## Design Decisions

The following design decisions were made:

1. **Hierarchical Navigation**: Left-to-right layout to show domain hierarchy (domains → models → concepts → entities)
2. **Responsive Layout**: Columns resize based on content, with entity details taking most space
3. **Contextual UI Shifting**: As users navigate relationships, the UI shifts to maintain focus
4. **Tabbed Entity Details**: Entity attributes and relationships are shown in separate tabs
5. **Breadcrumb Context**: Navigation history is maintained and visualized for easy traversal

## Next Steps

The next immediate steps are:

1. Study the actual domain model implementation in ednet_core
2. Update class references in MasterDetailNavigator
3. Implement proper relationship traversal
4. Connect to actual constraint validation system
5. Create a working demo with sample data
