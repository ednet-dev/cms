# EDNet Shell Interpreter - TDD Development Journal

## TDD Approach

We're following strict Red-Green-Refactor TDD for implementing the EDNet Shell Interpreter:

1. **RED**: Write a failing test for a specific feature or component
2. **GREEN**: Implement the minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve the code while keeping tests green

Each component will follow this cycle, building up the Shell Interpreter incrementally.

## Development Progress

### [2023-07-21] Initial Setup & First Component

#### Component: DomainMetadataInterpreter

**RED Phase**:

- Created test `domain_metadata_interpreter_test.dart`
- Added test case for loading concept metadata from a domain
- Test fails because the interpreter class doesn't exist

**GREEN Phase**:

- Implemented basic `DomainMetadataInterpreter` class
- Added concept registration with minimal functionality
- Tests now pass with basic implementation

**REFACTOR Phase**:

- Improved metadata caching
- Added docstrings
- Refactored concept registration method

#### Component: ConceptUIMapper

**RED Phase**:

- Created test `concept_ui_mapper_test.dart`
- Added test cases for mapping concept attributes to UI fields
- Test fails because mapper isn't implemented

### [2023-07-25] Theme System Components

#### Component: DisclosureLevelThemeExtension

**RED Phase**:

- Created test `disclosure_level_theme_extension_test.dart`
- Added test cases for theming at different disclosure levels
- Test fails because extension isn't implemented

**GREEN Phase**:

- Implemented `DisclosureLevelThemeExtension` class
- Added support for eight disclosure levels
- Added methods for adapting colors, spacing, and typography
- Tests now pass with basic implementation

**REFACTOR Phase**:

- Improved integration with Flutter's ThemeExtension
- Added builder methods for theme construction
- Added proper lerp functionality for smooth transitions

#### Component: SemanticColorsExtension

**RED Phase**:

- Created test `semantic_colors_extension_test.dart`
- Added tests for concept-specific theming
- Test fails because extension isn't implemented

**GREEN Phase**:

- Implemented `SemanticColorsExtension` class
- Added color mappings for domain concepts
- Tests now pass with basic implementation

**REFACTOR Phase**:

- Added dynamic color generation based on concept type
- Improved integration with theme system

#### Component: ThemeSpacingExtension

**RED Phase**:

- Created test `theme_spacing_extension_test.dart`
- Added tests for responsive spacing based on disclosure level
- Test fails because extension isn't implemented

**GREEN Phase**:

- Implemented basic spacing functions
- Added responsive scaling
- Tests now pass

**REFACTOR Phase**:

- Expanded spacing options
- Improved documentation
- Added context extension methods

## Theme System Next Steps

1. Complete the CheerfulThemeComponent implementation
2. Implement CLI and Minimalistic theme components
3. Create theme strategy for component selection
4. Implement theme provider with configuration integration
5. Add visual regression tests for theme components

## Next Steps

1. Complete the ConceptUIMapper implementation
2. Implement ListView Generator
3. Implement DetailView Generator
4. Add FormBuilder Service

## Open Questions

- How should we handle custom field types in the FormBuilder?
- What's the best approach for testing the UI components?
- Should we separate the UI generation from the metadata interpretation?

## Patterns & Architectural Decisions

1. **Registry Pattern** for component lookup/registration
2. **Builder Pattern** for UI component generation
3. **Observer Pattern** for event handling
4. **Strategy Pattern** for pluggable UI rendering based on concept type

## Test Coverage Goals

- Core interpretation layer: 90%+ coverage
- UI generation components: 80%+ coverage
- Event/command handling: 85%+ coverage

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize rebuilds by caching metadata interpretations
- Use lazy loading for complex UI components
- Consider memory usage when handling large domain models
