# EDNet Shell Architecture Implementation - Memory File

## Current Progress (Phase 1)

We've successfully implemented the core components of the EDNet Shell Architecture. This architecture provides a flexible, customizable UI layer for domain models with progressive disclosure capabilities.

### Components Implemented

1. **ShellApp**: The central coordinating component that interprets domain models and provides UX representation
   - Handles disclosure levels
   - Manages adapters
   - Provides domain visualization

2. **Configuration Injector**: A flexible configuration system using dependency injection principles
   - Multiple configuration types (domain, data, UX)
   - YAML configuration support
   - Priority-based application

3. **Canonical Model Adapter**: Implementation of the Canonical Data Model pattern
   - Standardizes entity representation
   - Enables consistent UI rendering

4. **UX Customization System**: Field descriptors, adapters, and validators
   - Progressive disclosure controls
   - Flexible field descriptors
   - Validation framework

5. **Example Client Application**: Demonstrates the full architecture in action

### Integrated Enterprise Integration Patterns

1. Channel Adapter pattern (ModelUXChannelAdapter)
2. Message Filter pattern (UXComponentFilter)
3. Message Aggregator pattern (DomainModelVisualizer)
4. Canonical Data Model pattern (UXCanonicalModel)

## UI Component Integration Plan (Phase 2)

After reviewing the existing UI components, we identified significant inconsistencies and fragmentation that need to be addressed:

### Key Architectural Inconsistencies

1. **Multiple Form Implementations**: `generic_entity_form.dart` and `constraint_validated_form.dart` overlap in responsibility without clear differentiation.
2. **Disjointed Visualization Components**: `semantic_entity_collection_view.dart`, `domain_entity_card.dart`, and `domain_list_item.dart` implement similar visualization patterns without coherent integration.
3. **Missing Entity Creation Flow**: Despite form components, there's no clear way to create new entities through the UI.
4. **Inconsistent Progressive Disclosure**: The `DisclosureLevel` enum exists but is applied inconsistently across components.
5. **Disconnected Navigation**: Navigation between entity views lacks cohesive implementation.

### Integration Strategy

1. **Unify Form Components**:
   - Merge the best features of `generic_entity_form.dart` and `constraint_validated_form.dart`
   - Create a single entry point in `ShellApp` for entity form generation
   - Implement consistent validation using domain constraints

2. **Standardize Entity Visualization**:
   - Create a unified adapter registry for all visualization types
   - Establish clear hierarchy between list, card, table, and detail views
   - Implement consistent theming and styling based on concept semantics

3. **Implement Entity Creation Flow**:
   - Add entity creation methods to `ShellApp` that leverage unified form components
   - Create standardized dialogs for entity creation with proper context
   - Ensure proper integration with domain model constraints

4. **Consolidate Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Implement consistent disclosure level handling across all components
   - Define clear guidelines for what is shown at each disclosure level
   - Ensure proper inheritance of disclosure levels across component hierarchy

5. **Integrate Navigation Flow**:
   - Establish clear navigation patterns between list, detail, edit, and create views
   - Integrate with `ShellApp.navigationService` for consistent breadcrumb and history support
   - Support deep linking to entity views

### UI Component Unification Tasks

1. **Phase 2.1: Forms & Creation**
   - [ ] Create unified form architecture by merging existing implementations
   - [ ] Implement standardized entity creation dialogs
   - [ ] Add entity creation methods to ShellApp
   - [ ] Ensure proper validation and error handling

2. **Phase 2.2: Visualization & Display**
   - [ ] Unify entity visualization components
   - [ ] Standardize progressive disclosure implementation
   - [ ] Implement consistent styling based on domain semantics
   - [ ] Create unified collection view with multiple visualization modes

3. **Phase 2.3: Navigation & Integration**
   - [ ] Implement cohesive navigation between entity views
   - [ ] Integrate with ShellApp navigation service
   - [ ] Support bookmarking and history
   - [ ] Add deep linking capabilities

## Pending Issues (From Phase 1)

1. **Core Type Definitions**:
   - Define DisclosureLevel enum
   - Create UXAdapterRegistry class
   - Define UX field types and descriptors

2. **Library Structure Issues**:
   - Fix part-of declarations and imports
   - Align with ednet_core library structure
   - Ensure proper Flutter imports

3. **Implementation Gaps**:
   - Complete the ProgressiveUXAdapter abstract class
   - Implement default adapters
   - Add filterFieldsByDisclosure implementation

4. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for shell components
   - Test configuration loading
   - Test adapter registration

5. **Documentation Refinement**:
   - Add API documentation for all public classes
   - Create usage examples
   - Document customization patterns

## Integration with Existing Code

We need to integrate with:

1. `ModelInstanceService` - Fix linter errors and align with EDNet architecture
2. `ProjectEntity` - Fix attribute type definitions and inheritance issues
3. `apps/one/lib/presentation` - Leverage the shell architecture for the UI layer

## Action Plan

1. Define core missing types in `packages/core/lib/domain/patterns/ui/`
2. Fix library structure and import issues
3. Complete implementation of abstract classes
4. Address linter errors in the existing code
5. Test integration with the existing project structure
6. Refine documentation 

## Next Steps

We have to extract application service abstraction as API connecting domain model aggregates and higher order user stories they build aside of default CRUD implementation we anyways provide. So IApplicationService manages behavioral aspects and is used by the shell app for discovery.

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement the unified entity creation flow by leveraging ShellApp, GenericEntityForm, and proper validation
2. Add a consistent navigation pattern between entity list views and creation/edit forms
3. Ensure all UI components respect progressive disclosure levels consistently
4. Document the integration patterns for other developers to follow
