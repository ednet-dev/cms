## Implementation Tasks

### Fixed Issues

- âœ… Added required imports and part directives to barrel file
- âœ… Created theme spacing extensions with disclosure level support
- âœ… Created theme context extensions with semantic concept awareness
- âœ… Created disclosure level theme extension
- âœ… Created semantic colors extension
- âœ… Fixed linting errors in theme extensions

### Remaining Issues

1. **Fix linting issues in CheerfulThemeComponent**:
   - WidgetStateProperty vs MaterialStateProperty migration
   - withValues vs withOpacity method usage
   - Ensure integration with the disclosure level system

### Next Steps

1. **Complete CheerfulThemeComponent migration**:
   - Fix all linting errors
   - Ensure proper integration with disclosure level
   - Test with sample Flutter app

2. **Implement remaining theme components**:
   - CLI Theme Component
   - Minimalistic Theme Component 
   - Custom Colors utility
   - ListItemCard component

3. **Implement theme strategy**:
   - Migrate theme strategy interface
   - Implement standard theme strategy
   - Connect with the Shell Architecture's concept of UX Adapters

4. **Implement theme provider**:
   - Create a theme provider that integrates with the Shell Architecture
   - Connect with the Configuration Injector system
   - Implement UX Channel for theme changes

## Architecture Integration Points

The migrated theme system needs to properly integrate with the following Shell Architecture components:

1. **Progressive Disclosure System**:
   - Theme components must adapt based on disclosure level
   - Colors, typography, and spacing should scale with disclosure level

2. **Configuration Injection**:
   - Theme configuration should be injectable via the Configuration system
   - Support for YAML-defined theme customizations

3. **UX Adaptation**:
   - Theme should support adaptations for different semantic concepts
   - Provide ways to customize appearance of domain entities

4. **Message-based Architecture**:
   - Theme changes should propagate through the UX Channel system
   - Components should react to theme change messages

## Testing Strategy

1. **Component Tests**:
   - Test each theme component in isolation
   - Verify color schemes and styles are applied correctly

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test theme integration with Shell components
   - Verify disclosure level changes affect theme appearance
   - Test theme switching functionality

3. **Visual Regression Tests**:
   - Capture screenshots of UI with different themes
   - Compare with baseline screenshots to detect unexpected changes
