/// A mixin that adds authorization capabilities to an entity.
///
/// This mixin provides:
/// - Access policy management
/// - Authorization checking
/// - Policy evaluation
///
/// By mixing this into an entity class, you can:
/// - Define access policies for the entity
/// - Check if users are authorized to perform actions
/// - Easily implement authorization rules
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// class Order extends Entity<Order> with AuthorizationFor<User, Order> {
///   // Order properties and methods
///   
///   @override
///   IEntities<IPolicy> get accessPolicies {
///     final policies = Entities<IPolicy>()
///       ..add(OwnerPolicy<User>(ownerId: customerId))
///       ..add(AdminPolicy<User>());
///     return policies;
///   }
/// }
/// ```

  /// 
  /// By default, all actions are allowed. Override this property
  /// to provide specific authorization rules.

  /// By default, returns a single [AllowAllPolicy].

    return policies;
  }

  /// Checks if a user is authorized to perform an action.
  /// 
  /// This method evaluates all access policies and returns true
  /// only if all policies allow the action.
  /// 
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [action]: The command to check authorization for
  /// - [user]: The user attempting the action
  /// 
  /// Returns:
  /// True if the user is authorized, false otherwise

/// Example usage:
/// ```dart

///   @override
///   bool allows(ICommand action, User user) {
///     return user.isAdmin;
///   }
/// }

  /// 
  /// Returns:
  /// True if the action is allowed, false otherwise
