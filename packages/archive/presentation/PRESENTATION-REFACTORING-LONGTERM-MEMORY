# EDNet One Presentation Layer Refactoring Plan

## Refactoring Workflow

### Principles
1. **Healthy State First**: All refactoring must start from a healthy state where the application can run from main.dart and render correctly in browser.
2. **Maintain Buildability**: After each logical refactoring step, ensure the application still builds successfully with Flutter.
3. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes rather than large rewrites to maintain stability.
4. **Test Frequently**: Run the application after each significant change to verify functionality.
5. **Leverage Core Domain Model**: Prefer extending or implementing interfaces from ednet_core rather than introducing third-party dependencies. The core domain model already provides robust functionality for equality, immutability, and other key features.

### Workflow Cycle
1. **Verify Starting State**: Ensure the application is in a healthy state before beginning refactoring.
2. **Select Refactoring Task**: Choose a specific task from the plan below, focusing on one logical change.
3. **Implement Changes**: Make the necessary code changes to complete the selected task.
4. **Build and Test**: Run `flutter build web` to verify the build succeeds.
5. **Verify Functionality**: Run the application to ensure it works as expected.
6. **Commit Changes**: Create a semantic commit scoped to "one" with a descriptive message of what was changed.
7. **Update Progress**: Mark the completed task in this document and update the current focus.
8. **Repeat**: Begin the next refactoring task from step 1.

### Commit Message Format
Format: `<type>(one): <description>`

Types:
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `feat`: Addition of a new feature
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change
- `test`: Adding or refactoring tests; no production code change

Example: `refactor(one): Move theme files to dedicated theme directory`

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan for the presentation layer of the EDNet One application. The plan is organized into phases to allow incremental improvements without disrupting the existing functionality.

## Phase 1: Project Structure Reorganization

### Step 1.1: Create New Folder Structure
- [x] Create the following folder structure:
  ```
  presentation/
  ├── pages/          # Container components (smart)
  ├── widgets/        # Reusable presentational components (dumb) 
  ├── state/          # State management
  │   ├── blocs/      # BLoC pattern implementations
  │   ├── models/     # UI models/DTOs
  │   └── providers/  # Service providers
  ├── layouts/        # Layout components and strategies
  ├── navigation/     # Navigation service and routes

## Best Practices for Component Decomposition

### Component Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should do one thing and do it well
2. **Interface Segregation**: Components should expose minimal interfaces needed for their function
3. **Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance for component reuse
4. **Statelessness**: Keep most components stateless where possible
5. **Pure Rendering**: Separate rendering logic from business logic

### Refactoring Strategy
1. Extract each logical section into its own widget file
2. Pass only the data and callbacks needed for that specific component
3. Use constructor parameters with named arguments for clarity
4. Document the purpose and usage of each component
5. Test each component in isolation before integration

### Performance Considerations
1. Use const constructors where appropriate
2. Implement shouldRebuild for custom render objects
3. Apply the equatable pattern for efficient equality checks
4. Consider lazy loading for complex component trees
5. Profile performance before and after refactoring
