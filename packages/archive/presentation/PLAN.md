# EDNet Core Flutter Integration Plan

## Progress Overview

We have successfully:
- Created a robust implementation of the `ResponsiveSemanticWrapper` that uses the disclosure level system
- Implemented the `SemanticPinningService` to handle pinning of artifacts for persistent visibility
- Created the `SemanticLayoutRequirements` class to define layout requirements based on semantics
- Implemented a skeleton version of `SemanticCodeTools` as a utility for code maintenance
- Created a sample for the `HolyTrinitySample` to demonstrate the architecture
- Integrated these components with the Shell Architecture's core concepts like progressive disclosure and semantic styling

## Next Steps

1. **Full Shell Integration**
   - Create a proper integration of the app with the `ShellApp` and `ShellAppRunner` components
   - Resolve package import issues
   - Ensure all domain model navigation works correctly

2. **Component Registration**
   - Register all migrated components with the Shell App's adapter registry
   - Create custom adapters for domain entities

3. **Semantic Wrappers**
   - Ensure all UI components use the `ResponsiveSemanticWrapper`
   - Implement progressive disclosure for all relevant UI elements

4. **Navigation Updates**
   - Replace the current navigation system with `ShellNavigationService`
   - Update breadcrumb service to work with domain models

5. **Testing**
   - Create specialized tests for the disclosure system
   - Test all semantic components in various screen sizes and configurations

## Migration Tasks

1. **Fix Package Structure**
   - Ensure ednet_core_flutter package is properly structured and accessible
   - Update pubspec.yaml dependencies and run pub get

2. **Update Main App**
   - Replace the existing app structure with the Shell Architecture
   - Initialize ShellApp with proper configuration

3. **Domain Model Integration**
   - Ensure domain models are properly connected to UI components
   - Use the adapter pattern to visualize domain entities

4. **UI Component Transformation**
   - Update existing UI components to leverage semantic styling
   - Use the disclosure level system for progressive UI complexity

## Testing Plan

1. Test basic navigation with domain models
2. Test progressive disclosure at different levels
3. Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
4. Test semantics-based pinning functionality
5. Test integration with existing domain model tools

## Technical Debt

1. Address linter errors in the main.dart file
2. Streamline package structure
3. Document integration approach for future reference
4. Create examples for custom adapters
