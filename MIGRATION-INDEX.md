# EDNet One Migration Index

This document serves as an index for migrating components from the current architecture in `ednet_one` to the new `ednet_core_flutter` package.

## Migration Principles

1. **Preserve Business Features**: Essential business features must be retained and properly integrated into the new architecture, including:
   - Breadcrumbs
   - Bookmarks management
   - Responsive/adaptive entity/concept/attribute rendering
   - Filters
   - Navigable domain relationships
   - Graphs and visualizations
   - Layout spacing modes

2. **Migration Order**: Components will be migrated from leaf nodes towards root nodes in the dependency tree.

3. **Semantic Evaluation**: Each component will be evaluated for architectural semantic coherence before migration.

4. **File Preservation**: Original files will only be deleted after successful migration and verification.

5. **Leverage Core for Modeling**: Always use `ednet_core` for modeling solutions and domain semantics.

6. **Enhanced Composability**: Focus on improving composability in overriding capabilities of low-level primitives:
   - Attributes, properties, relations
   - Concepts, entities, models, domains
   - Deployments, environments, projects
   - UI rendering and client customizations
 7. Challenge the current architecture and design patterns and if it is needed in ednet_core_flutter or is covered by existing patterns.
 8. 
## Target Architecture: EDNet Shell Architecture

The new architecture is based on the **EDNet Shell Architecture**, which provides a clean separation between domain models and UI representation through a flexible, customizable layer.

### Key Architectural Components

1. **ShellApp**
   - Central coordinating component
   - Interprets domain models and provides UX representation
   - Manages progressive disclosure levels
   - Coordinates adapter registry

2. **UX Adapters**
   - Bridge domain models with UI components
   - Implement the Channel Adapter pattern
   - Allow custom rendering of domain entities
   - Support different disclosure levels

3. **Configuration Injection**
   - Flexible configuration system using dependency injection
   - Support for YAML-defined customizations
   - Priority-based configuration application
   - Multiple configuration types (domain, data, UX)

4. **Canonical Model**
   - Standardizes entity representation for UI
   - Enables consistent rendering across components
   - Abstracts domain model complexity

5. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Controls UI complexity based on user expertise
   - Levels: minimal, basic, intermediate, advanced, complete
   - Reduces cognitive load with focused interfaces

6. **Enterprise Integration Patterns**
   - Channel Adapter (ModelUXChannelAdapter)
   - Message Filter (UXComponentFilter)
   - Message Aggregator (DomainModelVisualizer)
   - Canonical Data Model (UXCanonicalModel)
## Integration Strategy

1. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Start with essential features (minimal disclosure level)
   - Add complexity gradually as migration progresses
   - Test each component in isolation before integration

2. **Enterprise Integration Patterns**:
   - Use Channel Adapters for entity-UI bridges
   - Implement Message Filters for UI component filtering
   - Create Message Aggregators for combined visualizations
   - Build on the Canonical Data Model for standardized UI representation

3. **Deferred Implementation**:
   - Use "Not Implemented" adapters for incomplete features
   - Provide fallback UIs for in-progress components
   - Maintain backward compatibility where possible

4. **Migration Sequence**:
   - First migrate theme system and UI primitives
   - Then implement adapters for entities and domain model
   - Build navigation system compatible with Shell Architecture
   - Connect state management with message-based architecture
   - Finally migrate screens and modular components

## Migration Tracking

Each migration session should update this document with:

1. Updated status indicators for migrated components
2. Notes on any architectural decisions made
3. Changes to migration order if dependencies are discovered
4. Potential challenges or technical debt identified

This living document will guide the migration process and ensure no critical components are missed or improperly implemented.

## Integration Testing Plan

The migration will be verified through a comprehensive testing plan:

1. **Component Tests**:
   - Each migrated component must have corresponding tests
   - Tests should verify both functionality and integration

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Complete user journeys must be tested through shell architecture
   - Tests should include all disclosure levels

3. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Baseline performance metrics must be established
   - Post-migration performance must meet or exceed baseline

4. **Accessibility Verification**:
   - Components must maintain or improve accessibility
   - Screen reader compatibility must be verified

5. **Cross-Platform Testing**:
   - Verify component behavior across platforms (web, mobile, desktop)
   - Test platform-specific adaptations

## Visual Migration Map

A visual migration map will be maintained to track dependencies and progress:

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AttributeAdapters
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ RelationshipAdapters
â”œâ”€â”€ ConfigurationInjection

â””â”€â”€ MessageChannels
    â”œâ”€â”€ EntityMessages
    â”œâ”€â”€ NavigationMessages
    â””â”€â”€ UserActionMessages
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete theme migration with remaining components
2. Begin migrating base UI components (cards, lists)
3. Implement domain model channel adapter
4. Create initial UX adapters for core entity types
5. Develop migration test harness

## Technical Debt Tracking

As migration progresses, any technical debt should be tracked here:

1. Legacy styling in theme components needs refactoring (Medium priority)
2. Navigation state management needs adaptation to message architecture (High priority)
3. Domain model visualization requires performance optimization (Medium priority)
4. State management patterns should be unified (Medium priority)
