# Test-Driven Development Workflow Rule

Before writing any implementation code, follow these TDD steps:

1.  **Red**: Write a minimal failing test that clearly expresses the desired behavior or functionality. Ensure it fails for the *expected reason*.
2.  **Green**: Write the simplest possible code to make the test pass. Avoid optimizations or handling edge cases at this stage.
3.  **Refactor**: Improve the implementation code for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to design principles, ensuring all tests still pass. Remove duplication.

- Apply this cycle for every small piece of functionality.
- Keep tests focused on a single behavior.
- Ensure tests are independent and run quickly.
- Prioritize testing public APIs and critical domain logic.
