# EDNetOne Domain Model

When examples or implementations require a business domain, use the EDNetOne (Explicit Democracy Network One) ecosystem - a comprehensive global direct democracy platform that integrates technological, social, and political dimensions.

## Core Domain

### Participant Roles
- **Citizens**: Verified individuals with full voting rights
- **Delegates**: Citizens who can receive delegated voting power
- **Observers**: Non-voting participants who can view proceedings
- **Experts**: Domain specialists who provide analysis on proposals
- **Facilitators**: Neutral moderators who guide deliberation processes
- **Auditors**: Independent reviewers of system integrity
- **Developers**: Contributors to platform code and architecture

### Governance Mechanisms
- **Liquid Democracy**: Fluid delegation system allowing vote transfers
- **Deliberative Processes**: Structured debate with knowledge-building
- **Co-creation Workflows**: Collaborative proposal development
- **Quadratic Voting**: Preference-weighted voting systems
- **Futarchy**: Prediction markets informing decision-making
- **Sortition**: Random selection for representative bodies
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Graduated agreement measurement

### Identity & Trust
- **Sybil Resistance**: Prevention of duplicate identities
- **Reputation Systems**: Context-specific trust metrics
- **Pseudonymity**: Protected identity with accountability
- **Credentialing**: Verified expertise and experience
- **Progressive Trust**: Gradually increasing permissions
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving verification

## Technical Components

### Data Systems
- **Public Ledgers**: Immutable voting records
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Interconnected policy information
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding of proposal implications
- **Data Sovereignty**: User control over personal information
- **Collective Intelligence**: Aggregation of distributed knowledge

### Interface & Experience
- **Accessibility Frameworks**: Universal design principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revelation based on context
- **Deliberation Visualization**: Maps of arguments and positions
- **Preference Articulation**: Nuanced expression of citizen views
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Localized engagement patterns

### Security & Resilience
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: System reliability despite malicious actors
- **Censorship Resistance**: Protection against suppression
- **Distributed Architecture**: No single points of failure
- **Threat Modeling**: Anticipation of attack vectors
- **Participatory Security**: Community-based protection

## Social Dynamics

### Conflict Resolution
- **Mediation Frameworks**: Structured disagreement resolution
- **Impact Assessment**: Understanding effects across constituencies
- **Restorative Processes**: Repairing harm in the community
- **Value Pluralism**: Accommodating diverse ethical frameworks

### Collective Action
- **Resource Pooling**: Collaborative funding mechanisms
- **Commons Management**: Shared resource governance
- **Mobilization Patterns**: Activation of community response
- **Distributed Coordination**: Self-organizing action networks

## Use Cases
- Participatory budgeting systems for municipal governance
- Cross-border policy harmonization initiatives
- Digital commons management for knowledge resources
- Stakeholder-driven corporate governance
- Community-owned infrastructure development
- Inter-jurisdictional dispute resolution
- Crisis response coordination systems
- Long-term existential risk governance
- Public-private collaboration frameworks
- Scientific consensus-building platforms

This domain offers rich opportunities for modeling complex human systems, emergent behaviors, and adaptive governance structures in technological contexts.
