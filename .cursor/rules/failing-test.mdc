# EDNet Test Failure Analysis Rule

When encountering failing tests in the EDNet ecosystem, follow this structured approach:

## Analysis Hierarchy
1. **Test Correctness**: First evaluate if the test itself is correct in its expectations
2. **Implementation Issue**: Check if the implementation has a straightforward bug
3. **Semantic Consistency**: Investigate if the System Under Test (SUT) maintains semantic coherence with the domain model
4. **Cross-Component Coherence**: Assess potential inconsistencies between different parts of the codebase

## Domain Integrity Focus
- Prioritize maintaining semantic consistency over quick fixes
- Consider if the test reveals deeper architectural inconsistencies 
- Verify that domain concepts are implemented consistently across components
- Validate that invariants and domain rules are properly enforced

## Resolution Approach
- Document your reasoning about semantic inconsistencies found
- Propose targeted refactoring that improves architectural coherence
- Consider wider implications across the codebase when fixing domain model issues
- Update related tests to reflect correct domain understanding

Tests are more than validation tools - they are semantic guardians. Failing tests often reveal opportunities to improve domain model coherence.
