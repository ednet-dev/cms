# EDNet Package Publishing Rule

When preparing to publish packages to pub.dev, ensure the following:

## Version Management
- Use semantic versioning consistently
- Update CHANGELOG.md with all relevant changes
- Coordinate version bumps across dependent packages
- Validate version constraints in pubspec.yaml

## Quality Checks
- Run static analysis with pedantic/lint rules
- Ensure test coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Verify examples and documentation are up-to-date
- Check for breaking changes and document migration paths

## Publication Process
- Use melos for coordinated releases
- Test dry-run publication before actual release
- Validate pub points and address any issues
- Update package homepage and repository links

## Post-Publication
- Tag releases in the repository
- Update example projects to use the latest versions
- Announce significant releases in appropriate channels
- Monitor initial feedback and address critical issues promptly

Publishing is the key moment when your work becomes available to others - maintain high standards to ensure a positive developer experience.
