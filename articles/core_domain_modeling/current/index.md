# EDNet Core Domain Modeling Series Index

## Series Articles

1. **Introduction to EDNet Core Domain Modeling**  
   *An overview of EDNet Core's approach to domain-driven design and how it provides a flexible foundation for building domain models in Dart.*

2. **The Entity Pattern in EDNet Core**  
   *A deep dive into the fundamental building block of domain models - the Entity class, its identity management, attribute handling, and validation capabilities.*

3. **Working with Entity Collections in EDNet Core**  
   *How EDNet Core manages collections of entities through the Entities class, providing rich querying, validation, and relationship management features.*

4. **Mastering Aggregate Roots in EDNet Core**  
   *Understanding how EDNet implements the Aggregate Root pattern to enforce domain boundaries and maintain consistency through events and commands.*

5. **Meta-Modeling with Concepts**  
   *Exploring EDNet's meta-model capabilities through the Concept class, enabling rich domain model definition and introspection at runtime.*

6. **Policies and Rules: Enforcing Domain Logic**  
   *How EDNet's policy system enables declarative business rules that can be validated and enforced across the domain model.*

7. **Event Sourcing and Domain Events**  
   *Implementing event sourcing patterns with EDNet Core to capture all state changes as a sequence of events.*

8. **The Command-Event-Policy Cycle**  
   *Building reactive domain models with the full command-event-policy cycle that drives autonomous domain behavior.*

## Upcoming Features (Roadmap)
