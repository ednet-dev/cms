Simulating a Full Team with Local Multi‑Agent AI (EDNET Project)

Implementing agentic workflows for your EDNET digital democracy platform can let one person leverage a “virtual team” of AI agents. By using multiple coordinated agents – each with specialized roles – you can cover everything from NGO operations to coding, QA, and even conversational app building. The key is choosing the right multi-agent orchestration framework, integrating the necessary tools/APIs (GitHub, CI, Flutter, etc.), and structuring agents and tasks effectively. Below, we outline the best open-source frameworks and patterns to achieve this on your powerful M2 Mac, using local models like DeepSeek-Coder and Qwen 2.5 Coder.

Multi‑Agent Orchestration Frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, etc.)

Several open-source frameworks exist to coordinate multiple AI agents. Each has different strengths in terms of ease of use, flexibility, and suitability for team-based workflows:
	•	CrewAI (GitHub: crewAIInc/crewAI) – A fast Python framework built from scratch for orchestrating role-playing agents in a “crew” ￼. CrewAI uses an intuitive crew metaphor: you define a cast of agents with distinct roles, goals, and tools, and orchestrate them through tasks or flows. It excels at modeling human team structures; each agent can have a specialized skillset or personality, and they collaborate on tasks or subtasks ￼. This role-based approach makes CrewAI natural for team workflows (e.g. a “Planner” delegating to a “Developer” and “Tester”) ￼. It’s relatively easy to configure and supports advanced features like memory and error handling. CrewAI is a great fit for simulating your NGO staff or product team. Importantly, it supports local LLMs (like via Ollama) out-of-the-box ￼, so you can plug in Qwen or DeepSeek models instead of OpenAI’s API. (CrewAI even notes that it can connect to Ollama for local model usage ￼.) In short, CrewAI provides a good balance between simplicity and power for multi-agent “crew” scenarios ￼.
	•	Microsoft AutoGen (GitHub: microsoft/autogen) – An open-source framework focused on conversation-based multi-agent interactions ￼. AutoGen enables multiple agents (and humans) to talk to each other in an automated chat setting, coordinating via messages. Agents are “conversable” and can integrate tools or act proactively in an asynchronous, event-driven loop ￼. This is useful when you want agents to brainstorm or critique each other in natural language (e.g. a Developer agent and a Reviewer agent chatting to refine code). AutoGen supports flexible agent roles and integration of tools/humans in the loop ￼. In your case, AutoGen could shine for the Conversational App Builder (Workflow 4) or any scenario where agents (or agent+user) need rich back-and-forth dialogue. It’s backed by Microsoft and designed for research, with support for complex agent networks and asynchronous messaging for scalability ￼. The downside is that it lacks an explicit process framework – you have to manage the conversation flow in code, which can become complex as tasks grow ￼. In practice, AutoGen is great for open-ended multi-agent chats and dynamic collaboration patterns, but less structured than CrewAI.
	•	LangChain’s LangGraph (GitHub: langchain-ai/langgraph) – A framework for building agent workflows as graphs (DAGs) ￼. LangGraph treats each step or agent as a node in a directed acyclic graph, giving you fine-grained control over sequencing, branching, parallelism, and state passing. This is the most flexible and low-level approach: you explicitly define how agents transition between steps, which is useful for complex, multi-step processes with error-handling or loops ￼ ￼. For example, you could model a workflow where a “Plan” node leads into parallel “Code” and “Design” nodes, then joins into a “Test” node, etc. LangGraph inherits LangChain’s tooling and integrates with Python/JS, and even provides a visual representation of agent flows. It’s production-oriented and has been used by companies like Replit for reliable coding agents ￼ ￼. However, LangGraph has a steep learning curve – you effectively need to design the agentic architecture (the graph) yourself ￼. It may be overkill unless you require complex branching logic or enterprise-level observability. If your workflows become very complex or you need strict control over every step (e.g. for safety or determinism), LangGraph is an option. Otherwise, frameworks like CrewAI might cover your needs with less overhead ￼.
	•	OpenDevin / OpenHands (GitHub: AI-App/OpenDevin.OpenDevin and All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) – An open-source project aiming to replicate Devin, an autonomous AI software engineer ￼. OpenDevin is specialized for coding tasks: it equips an agent with a shell, code editor, and web browser to perform software development activities ￼. The agent can read/write code, generate scripts, run tests, and even browse documentation. Notably, OpenDevin runs all bash commands inside a Docker sandbox for safety ￼ – this is important when letting an AI execute code on your machine. The project is still alpha (rapidly evolving), but it demonstrates state-of-the-art capabilities for autonomous coding. In your monorepo maintenance, you could leverage OpenDevin’s approach: for example, have an AI agent spin up a sandbox to run flutter test or dart format safely. OpenHands (the successor to OpenDevin) is expanding to a platform for AI software devs, merging agents that can plan (CodeAct planners) and execute code. While OpenDevin is not a full multi-agent orchestra (it’s more of a single “AI engineer” agent), it can be integrated as a tool or sub-agent in your system – e.g. use CrewAI to assign a “CodingAgent” role that internally uses OpenDevin’s sandbox execution for certain tasks. If your focus is on code automation, OpenDevin provides battle-tested components for running and validating code.
	•	OpenAgents (Project & PyPI: openagents) – An open platform that allows creating and hosting AI agents with a web UI and plugin ecosystem ￼ ￼. OpenAgents comes with a UI for interacting with agents and supports three main agent types out-of-the-box: a DataAgent (for data analysis), a PluginsAgent (with access to 200+ tools via a plugin registry), and a WebAgent (for autonomous web browsing) ￼. It’s designed to be user-friendly and allow quick use of agent functionality via a central server. In context, OpenAgents might be useful if you want a ready-made interface for some tasks (like having a browsing agent or a plugin-enabled agent for Notion, etc.). However, given you want tight integration with your specific EDNET project and custom DSL, OpenAgents might be less flexible than building your own flows with the frameworks above. It’s more of a platform than a framework – great for quick setups and demonstrations, but for a tailored architecture (with your own codegen, CI, etc.), you’d likely treat this as optional. Still, it exemplifies how an open multi-agent system can be structured with a central server coordinating specialized agents ￼.

Recommendation: For your use case, CrewAI is a top choice to simulate a full team. It naturally models multiple specialists working together ￼ and has built-in support for role definitions, task assignments, and even parallel workflows. Its role-based design aligns perfectly with your Meta Domain Context (MDC) YAML role files – you can plug those in as agent definitions. CrewAI’s design metaphor (“crew” of autonomous agents) will make it straightforward to map each team member (developer, QA, PM, etc.) to an AI agent and orchestrate their collaboration on tasks ￼. It’s also Python-based and fairly extensible for adding custom tools.

That said, you might mix frameworks for different workflows: for example, use CrewAI for the structured team collaborations (Workflows 1–3), and leverage AutoGen for the conversational app builder (Workflow 4) where a more fluid back-and-forth is needed. These frameworks are not mutually exclusive – you could have an AutoGen-driven agent conversing with a user, which when needed calls into a CrewAI-managed “dev team” to perform a complex task. The key is to choose a primary orchestration method for each scenario that minimizes complexity.

All of the above frameworks are open-source, so you can self-host them and even modify as needed. They also integrate with each other to some extent (for example, you can integrate LangGraph with AutoGen or CrewAI with LangChain tools, etc., as some guides show ￼). For clarity and maintainability, starting with a single framework (CrewAI) and extending it is likely easiest.

Tool Integration and MCP (Connecting Agents to GitHub, CI, etc.)

Having smart agents is only half the battle – they need access to tools and data to actually do work. In your case, that includes: code repositories (Git/GitHub), issue trackers, documentation (Notion/CMS), scheduling systems, CLI tools (Flutter, CI pipelines), and more. You should design your agent system such that each agent can securely and effectively use these tools. There are two complementary approaches:

1. Native Tool Integrations via Framework: Most agent frameworks let you define custom “tools” or functions the agents can call. For example, you can give an agent a run_shell_command tool that executes a bash command and returns output, or a create_github_issue tool that hits the GitHub API. In CrewAI, you can register tools (Python functions) that agents invoke when needed. Likewise, AutoGen and LangChain provide mechanisms to define tool usage (often via function calling or plugins). You will likely set up tools such as:
	•	Shell/CLI Tool: Allows running shell commands on your machine (or in a sandbox). This is essential for Workflow 3 (running tests, builds) and Workflow 4 (running the ednet_code_generator or Flutter CLI). For safety, consider sandboxing these operations. For instance, OpenDevin’s approach of a Docker sandbox ￼ could be integrated – e.g. a “ShellAgent” that actually executes commands inside a container to prevent harm to the host. Alternatively, carefully scope what commands are allowed. Using a shell tool, the CI/CD tasks (like running tests or deploying) can be triggered by agents. The agent could run a test suite and parse results to decide next steps (e.g. QA agent runs tests, sees failures, reports back).
	•	GitHub and Version Control Tools: You’ll want agents to read and modify code. This can be done by direct filesystem access (since you’re local, an agent can open files in the monorepo to read context or write changes). In addition, for realism and collaboration, agents can use Git/GitHub. For example, a “Dev Agent” could git checkout -b feature_x, write code, then git commit & push, and open a pull request via the GitHub API. A “Reviewer Agent” could then comment on the PR. To enable this, set up a GitHub API token and use a library or custom calls for operations like creating issues or PRs. You might create tools like open_issue(title, body), create_pr(branch, summary), etc. There are libraries (e.g. PyGitHub) or GraphQL API calls for these. If you prefer a standardized integration, consider using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for GitHub. Anthropic’s MCP is a new open standard that provides a unified way for AI to connect to external systems ￼. In fact, an open-source MCP server for GitHub already exists – it exposes repository management and file operations to AI via a consistent interface ￼. By running an MCP GitHub server locally, your agents could, for example, call “GitHub.searchCode(query)” or “GitHub.createIssue(…)” without you writing the API call logic – the MCP layer handles it. This can simplify tool integration, and as a bonus, multiple agents can share the same MCP tool context. (MCP effectively acts as a shared “workspace” or hub: agents with different roles can coordinate through a common set of tools without each having direct API integration ￼.)
	•	Notion or CMS Tools: For documentation and planning (especially in Workflow 1 and Workflow 2), your agents should interface with your knowledge bases. This could be Notion (for meeting notes, plans) or your ednet_cms (if that is a content repository). Notion has an API that allows creating pages, inserting content, querying databases, etc. You could give, say, the NGO/PM agent a notion_create_page(title, content) tool or even direct access to certain pages for appending text. Similarly, if ednet_cms has a backend API or if it’s file-based (e.g., markdown files in the repo), an agent can write to those. There might not be an MCP server for Notion yet (as MCP is new), but you can use direct integration or look into community-created plugins (the OpenAgents plugin registry might have something, or frameworks like LangChain have Notion loaders). The Marketing agent could use this to publish blog updates or the PM agent to update a project plan in Notion.
	•	Scheduling/Calendar Tools: In the NGO workflow, scheduling and planning is key. You might integrate a Google Calendar API for setting events or deadlines. There are MCP connectors for Google Calendar as well ￼. For instance, the “Assistant/Scheduler” agent could have a schedule_event(date, description) tool that actually creates a calendar invite. If you prefer not to hit external APIs, the agent could maintain a local calendar file or simply output a schedule for you to manually enter. But connecting to a real calendar would close the loop autonomously. MCP’s open-source servers include connectors for Google Calendar, Gmail, Slack, etc., which could be repurposed for NGO communications ￼.
	•	Web and Data Tools: If agents need to do research (say for grant writing or market research), a web browsing tool is useful. OpenAgents includes a web-browsing agent, and others have used headless browser tools (Playwright or Puppeteer). MCP also lists a Puppeteer server for browsing web pages via an agent ￼. You might not need this immediately, but it’s good for an AI content writer to verify facts or gather info online. Ensure to sandbox or limit it to safe domains if used.

Using the frameworks, you’ll typically register these tools and then specify in the agent prompts (or programmatically) that the agent can use them. For example, CrewAI allows tools to be part of a crew’s capabilities, and the agent will call them when appropriate (based on either prompt instructions or function calling if using an OpenAI-like interface). Always implement some checks – e.g., limit shell commands or review content – to prevent mistakes.

2. Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Unified Integration: As mentioned, MCP is a standard that “provides a universal, open protocol for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol.” ￼ Instead of writing custom integration code for each tool, you run generic MCP servers and connect your agent framework to them (via an MCP client SDK). This way, when your agent needs to access, say, GitHub, it calls a standardized action that the GitHub MCP server executes. The agent doesn’t need to know API details – it discovers available actions from the MCP server (dynamic capability discovery) ￼. This can greatly simplify adding new integrations. For instance, today you hook up GitHub and Calendar; tomorrow you add a Postgres database or Slack workspace by just running the respective MCP server and not changing your agent code ￼ ￼. MCP also shines in multi-agent scenarios: it essentially provides a shared toolbox that all agents can use concurrently ￼. Agents can exchange information through these tools (for example, a Planning agent might write a design doc to a repository which a Developer agent later reads via the Git MCP server). Early adopters (like Replit, Block, etc.) have embraced MCP to connect coding agents to real repositories and dev environments ￼. Since you are operating locally, you can run MCP servers on your machine. (Anthropic open-sourced many MCP servers including for Git, GitHub, Google Drive, etc. – see the modelcontextprotocol/servers repo ￼.) Adopting MCP in your architecture could future-proof your integrations and reduce custom code. Framework-wise, support for MCP is growing – for example, Composio’s MCP SDK or upcoming integration in agent frameworks. Even if not natively supported, you can call MCP servers via HTTP requests (they often provide a local HTTP or socket API). Using MCP is not strictly necessary, but it aligns well with building a scalable, extensible agent platform. It gives your AI team a “USB-C”-like standardized port to connect to any tool or data source ￼.

In summary, plan out the key tools each workflow’s agents will need and implement those either directly or via MCP. Keep security in mind (especially for code execution). With the right tools, your agents won’t be siloed chatbots – they’ll truly act on the world: coding, documenting, scheduling, publishing, and more.

Workflow 1: NGO Operations (Grant Writing, Partnerships, etc.)

For managing NGO operations, imagine an AI “assistant team” helping you and your business development partner run the organization. The goals here include content generation (grant proposals, reports), scheduling and planning, and strategic advice (partnership opportunities, impact analysis). You can set up a small crew of agents to cover these functions:
	•	Grant Writer Agent: This agent specializes in writing proposals, grant applications, and documentation. It can take an outline or goal and produce a draft, pulling in relevant data (past project metrics, research citations) as needed. You’d feed it background info on your NGO’s mission and past work so it has context. Tool integration: it might use a web search or RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to gather statistics or references for grant applications. It could also interface with your CMS/Notion to pull facts (e.g., a project description) or to save the final document. For example, you prompt: “Draft a 5-page proposal for the ABC Foundation grant, focusing on digital democracy outcomes,” and the Grant Writer agent produces it, then perhaps uses Notion API to create a page with the content for you to review.
	•	Scheduling/Logistics Agent: This agent helps with meeting scheduling, calendar management, and task reminders. It can coordinate times, draft emails, and ensure plans are documented. It might monitor a timeline for grant deadlines or partner meetings. With integration to Calendar (via Google Calendar API or MCP), it could automatically schedule or propose slots. It could also maintain to-do lists (maybe in the CMS or a task file). For example, if a grant is due in 1 month, this agent could remind the team (via a summary or even by sending an email, if allowed) and suggest intermediate milestones.
	•	Strategy/Research Agent: This agent acts like a business development analyst – it can research potential partners, summarize news in the digital democracy space, or SWOT-analyze a project plan. It might use web browsing tools to scan news or use an internal knowledge base of NGO best practices. In a meeting, this agent could listen (via transcript input) and then output suggestions. It can also help with brainstorming sessions (e.g., “list 5 innovative ideas to engage youth voters digitally”).

These agents can work collaboratively or independently. Using CrewAI, you might instantiate them as a crew: NGOCrew = { GrantWriter, Scheduler, Strategist }. You (the human) interface with them via a command-line or simple UI. For instance, you assign a task: “Prepare for upcoming grant X and schedule partner meeting Y.” The NGOCrew could internally divide this: the GrantWriter starts drafting the grant doc, the Scheduler sets up the meeting date and prepares an agenda, and the Strategist compiles relevant partner info to brief you. CrewAI can run these in parallel or sequence (it supports parallel tasks in a crew) ￼. If needed, they can message each other: e.g., the Strategist agent provides data that the GrantWriter incorporates into the proposal.

Agent prompts/roles: Define each with an MDC-style YAML (or directly in code) describing their role, knowledge, and tone. For example, the Grant Writer’s profile might include: “Role: Grant Writer AI – expert in nonprofit grant applications, persuasive writing. Knowledge: EDNET mission, previous grants summary…” etc. This ensures it stays on point. The Scheduler agent might have: “Role: Operations Assistant – proactive about timelines, detail-oriented in scheduling, always confirms availability with stakeholders.”

Tools: Grant Writer uses possibly internet_search (if allowed), or at least internal data. Scheduler uses calendar_event and email (you could integrate an email API via SMTP or Gmail API for sending calendar invites or follow-ups). If not automating email, it could draft the text for you to send. The Strategist might use a web_browse or just rely on an internal database of partners (which you could store in a JSON and let the agent query).

By delegating these tasks to agents, you and your human partner can focus on decision-making while the AI handles first drafts and busywork. You’d still review outputs (AI grant drafts need human polishing), but it accelerates the process. This workflow is less about coding and more about knowledge work, so you might prioritize a strong language model here (maybe a general LLM if code models are weaker in creative writing). You could even run a different model for this crew (e.g., a fine-tuned Llama2 on writing tasks) while using Qwen/DeepSeek for code tasks – CrewAI allows connecting different agents to different model backends if needed.

Workflow 2: Digital Product Team Simulation

In this workflow, you want to simulate a real product development team for EDNET, with each functional vertical represented by an agent. This essentially creates an AI-driven software team that can plan, build, and deliver features collaboratively. Inspired by research like ChatDev (virtual software company with CEO, CTO, Programmer, Tester, etc.) ￼, you can set up a similar structure:

Team Roles (Agents):
	•	Product Manager (PM) Agent: This agent handles product planning, feature definitions, and prioritization. It should create user stories or tasks (e.g., in GitHub Issues or a project board), define acceptance criteria, and maintain the roadmap. The PM agent might start a sprint by outlining goals and tasks for others. It can take high-level input from you (the real stakeholder) about priorities and break them down. Tooling: access to GitHub Issues/Projects (to log tasks), and possibly the CMS/Notion to record requirements or meeting notes. It can also summarize progress for weekly reports.
	•	UX Designer Agent: Responsible for user experience ideas – this agent could produce wireframes (perhaps described in text or generated as simple ASCII/UI markup), suggest UI improvements, or review the app from an end-user perspective. While it might not directly create Figma designs, it could output UX specifications (“Screen should have a login form with 2 fields…”) which the Developer agent can implement. It might comment on usability when reviewing features. If you have a design system in EDNET, provide it as context so the agent follows your style guidelines.
	•	Developer Agent: One (or multiple) agents focusing on coding. Since EDNET is in Dart/Flutter, you could have a Flutter UI Developer agent and a Backend Dart Developer agent, or just one “Software Engineer” agent if scope is manageable. This agent(s) will implement features by writing code in the monorepo. They will respond to tasks from the PM agent by coding, and then commit code. Tooling: direct access to the codebase (files), the ability to run the ednet_code_generator if needed (for boilerplate via DSL), and Git operations. They might use the shell tool to run Flutter tests locally. You might incorporate a code-formatting tool so the agent can auto-format code before commit (to meet style guidelines). The Developer agent should also be aware of the architecture (maybe load the MDC of the project or relevant code context) to avoid introducing inconsistencies. If multiple dev agents, they can even do pair-programming (or one can generate code and another review it).
	•	QA/Test Agent: A quality assurance agent will test the outputs. It can review PRs, run the app, and check for bugs or unmet requirements. LLMs can simulate testing by reading code and writing test cases or by actually running tests via a tool. For instance, the QA agent could examine the Developer’s code diff and point out potential issues (“I see you didn’t handle the null case here”). It could also generate additional unit tests or integration test scenarios. Using the shell tool, it might execute flutter test and interpret failures. If a bug is found, it can report it back (maybe re-opening a GitHub issue or commenting on the PR). This creates a feedback loop where the Developer agent then fixes it.
	•	Marketing/Communications Agent: Once a feature is ready, this agent can draft release notes, blog announcements, or social media posts. It ensures that the value of the feature is articulated to users. It might pull information from the PM (user story) and the UX (design changes) to write a coherent announcement. Tool: could post to the CMS (ednet_cms) or prepare Markdown for a blog.
	•	Analytics/Data Agent: This agent focuses on metrics and data. For a new feature, it can suggest what analytics events to track, design A/B tests, or analyze any user data if available. If you have an analytics pipeline, it could query it (or in absence of real data, specify what data should be collected and how to interpret it). For example, after release, the Analytics agent might report: “Feature X adoption is 20% in first week; users spend Y minutes on new interface – suggests we need a tutorial.” In planning, it can add metrics to feature requirements (“log event when user completes action Z”).

These agents together mirror a real product team. To orchestrate them, CrewAI’s role-based crew is ideal. You can either have one big crew containing all roles that work on a project together, or separate crews that interact (e.g., a “DevTeam” crew of Dev+QA and a “BizTeam” crew of PM+Marketing that communicate via shared artifacts like the repo and CMS). A straightforward way is a single crew where agents take turns or work in parallel on their parts of a task.

Example scenario: You (as leadership or CEO role) tell the team: “We need to add a feature for user profile customization in the app.” The PM agent creates a GitHub Issue “Feature: Profile Customization” with details. PM breaks it into sub-tasks: “Backend: API for profile, UI: screen for editing profile, QA: test profile flows, Analytics: track profile updates.” The Developer agent picks up “Backend” and starts coding in a branch, using the codegen tool if the EDNET DSL is applicable (perhaps EDNET DSL defines data models that can be code-generated). The UX agent simultaneously provides a draft of how the profile screen should look (maybe in a pseudo-DSL or written spec). The Developer agent implements the UI according to that spec. Once done, Developer agent opens a PR on GitHub. The QA agent sees the PR, checks out the branch (via Git tool), runs tests, maybe even runs the app in headless mode, and finds an issue with input validation. QA agent comments on the PR or opens a bug issue. Developer agent fixes the bug and updates the PR. Once tests pass, PM agent can “approve” the PR (or you as human do final approval), and merge happens. Marketing agent then takes the merged feature and drafts a release note: “Users can now customize their profile – here’s how…” and puts that in the CMS or Notion. Analytics agent sets up an analytics event schema for “ProfileUpdated” and provides that to Developer to implement (the Developer agent can add analytics code accordingly).

All this can be simulated via the agents’ conversation or task outputs. It’s essentially an AI Scrum team. In fact, this mirrors the ChatDev study which organized a virtual software company with roles like CEO, CTO, Programmer, Tester working in stages of design -> coding -> testing -> deployment ￼. You’re extending that concept with more roles (UX, Marketing, etc.) to cover the full product lifecycle.

Coordination mechanisms: You can allow the agents to talk to each other in a shared chat (AutoGen style) to coordinate (“QA: I found a bug in module X”). Or use a more structured approach where each agent reads the artifacts from others. For example, using GitHub as the central source of truth, the agents don’t chat directly but communicate through issues, PRs, and files (just like a real distributed team). The PM agent writes an issue – the Developer agent reads it because it’s in the repo context; the QA agent reads the PR diff, etc. This is a powerful pattern because it leaves an audit trail (issues, commits) that you can review and also serves as implicit communication. CrewAI could manage this by sequential tasks: Task 1 – PM agent creates issues (and yields), Task 2 – Dev agent works on code (and yields), Task 3 – QA agent tests, etc., with some logic to iterate if needed. Or run some in parallel (Dev and UX could work in parallel tasks then synchronize). CrewAI’s support for sequential and parallel flows can be used to orchestrate this pipeline ￼.

Memory & context: Each agent should maintain some memory of their domain. For instance, the PM agent should remember the overall roadmap (maybe stored in a prompt or an external file it references). The Developer agent should have context of the codebase – you might integrate a vector store of code embeddings for it to retrieve relevant code snippets (though with 64GB RAM, you might afford giving quite a bit of code context in prompts, especially using 32K+ token models if available). The QA agent could benefit from a test cases repository or a checklist of common pitfalls. Ensuring each agent has access to shared context like the EDNET architecture document (via an MCP knowledge base or a simple shared file) will make their outputs more coherent.

Workflow 3: Solo Dev Monorepo Maintenance (AI Engineering Team)

Here, you are essentially amplifying yourself as a solo developer by creating a virtual senior engineering team for your EDNET monorepo. You have roles like Principal Engineer, Software Architect, multiple Senior Devs (with different expertise), etc., defined in your MDC YAML files. The goal is to have these AI agents assist (or even autonomously handle) tasks like code refactoring, reviewing, planning architectural changes, and maintaining quality across ednet_core, ednet_cms, and ednet_code_generator modules.

Agent Roles: Based on typical senior engineering team structure, you might have:
	•	Principal Engineer (Lead) Agent: Oversees the entire codebase, makes high-level decisions, and prioritizes work. This agent can function as a planner/manager for technical tasks. For example, if you describe a feature or a problem, the Principal Eng. agent decides how to break it down: “We should refactor module X for performance and have two devs work on Y and Z features.” It understands the big picture and the long-term roadmap of the codebase (you’d feed it the architectural vision document or have it trained on that).
	•	Architect Agent: Focuses on ensuring that solutions fit the overall architecture and design principles. This agent reviews proposed implementations for alignment with best practices and EDNET’s design patterns. If a Developer agent comes up with a solution, the Architect might suggest improvements or catch design flaws (e.g., “This approach introduces tight coupling between ednet_core and ednet_cms; consider using an interface or event instead.”). The Architect could also generate design docs for major changes, which then guide the devs.
	•	Flutter UI Specialist Agent: A senior dev agent whose specialty is Flutter UI and user experience in the app. This agent will handle tasks related to the frontend (ensuring widgets are optimized, UI follows the intended design, etc.). They might refactor UI code for better state management or implement new UI features. They are intimately familiar with Flutter frameworks (maybe your MDC YAML for this role includes knowledge of Flutter best practices).
	•	Dart/Backend Specialist Agent: Another dev agent focusing on backend logic, data management, and the codegen system. This agent would work on ednet_core and the code generation logic in ednet_code_generator. They ensure the DSL translations are correct, optimize the generator, and manage data models or API integrations in the core.
	•	QA/Testing Agent (SDET): Although you as a solo dev might not have a separate QA normally, here an AI QA can help maintain quality. This agent continuously generates and updates tests, runs them, and checks for regressions. If you do a refactor, the QA agent can run the test suite and verify nothing broke, or if something did, pinpoints it. It can also suggest adding tests for newly added code paths.
	•	Code Reviewer Agent: You could have an agent explicitly act as a reviewer (like a code review buddy). It will look at diffs or proposed changes by Developer agents (or by you) and provide feedback from a critical perspective. While the Architect focuses on design, the Reviewer might focus on code clarity, potential bugs, or style issues. (This could be combined with QA or kept separate to simulate a rigorous review process.)

Using these agents, you can simulate a full code review and development cycle even when coding alone. A possible use-case: you write a piece of code (or an AI Dev agent writes it), then pass it to the Reviewer agent for feedback. The Reviewer catches some issues and suggests fixes, which the Dev agent (or you) implement. The Architect agent might chip in if the change has bigger implications (“We might hit scaling issues with this approach next year…”). The QA agent then runs tests to ensure all is well. This is similar to having a dev team where no code goes unreviewed or untested – increasing code quality.

Incorporating MDC YAMLs: You mentioned you have YAML files defining each role’s context (MDC – Meta Domain Context). You should use these as the system prompts or initial memory for each agent. For example, when instantiating the Architect agent in the framework, load the YAML content (which might include the agent’s objectives, knowledge base, and boundaries) as the agent’s persona. The YAML might also list relevant parts of the code or docs that each role should know. Keep these updated as you refine roles. In fact, you can have the agents themselves help refine their MDC files: e.g., after some interactions, you might ask the Architect agent to output any adjustments it would make to its role description or knowledge, then update the YAML accordingly (a semi-autonomous role evolution).

Workflow specifics: In practice, maintain a backlog of tasks (could be in issues or a simple list) for the monorepo. Use the Principal Eng. agent to decide who (which agent) works on each task. For instance:
	•	Task: “Refactor the data layer in ednet_core to use repository pattern.” Principal assigns Architect to outline approach, then Backend Dev agent to implement.
	•	Task: “Upgrade Flutter version and ensure compatibility.” Assign UI Dev to fix any deprecated widget usage, QA agent to run full regression.
	•	Task: “Improve code generation for new DSL features.” Assign Backend Dev to update ednet_code_generator, then maybe Reviewer to double-check output quality.

The collaboration could be orchestrated by a central manager (could be the Principal agent itself acting as a manager). Alternatively, you as the user can trigger each agent in sequence: ask Architect for a design, feed design to Dev agent to implement, then feed diff to Reviewer, etc. If using CrewAI, you can encode this as a workflow: for each task, a sub-crew runs: (Architect -> Dev -> Reviewer -> QA). CrewAI’s flows can encode this sequence, and even repeat if Reviewer requests changes (kind of a loop until done).

Tools and environment: The dev agents will need robust access to the code. A good approach is to integrate a local vector database for code: e.g., use LlamaIndex or LangChain to index your codebase so agents can query “where is the definition of X class?” easily. This avoids loading the entire code in prompt but allows reference. Semantic search tools or even GPT’s function calling to search code can be integrated (or use the Git MCP server’s search functionality). Also, integrate your schema.json for the DSL as a reference for agents working on the code generator – the agent should validate changes against the schema to avoid breaking the DSL.

For executing code, the QA agent or Dev agent might need to run the generator and compile/test. They can use the shell tool to do dart pub run build_runner or whatever your codegen requires, then flutter analyze and flutter test. If something fails, capture the output and feed it back into the agent’s context (so it knows the error and can attempt a fix). This is essentially the workflow of an autonomous coder: code -> run -> see error -> fix, which your multi-agent system can collaboratively handle.

A concrete example: Suppose you want to add a new property to a domain model in the EDNET DSL and propagate it. The Principal agent decides this is a task and maybe outlines steps. The Backend Dev agent modifies the DSL schema (ednet.yaml spec) and the code generator to handle the new property. It runs the code generator on sample input to verify it outputs correct code. If there’s an error (say, a part of codegen didn’t consider something), the QA agent catches it by running tests. The QA agent reports, “New property not handled in serialization – tests failing.” The Dev agent fixes that, QA passes. Now the Reviewer agent reads the final diff (which might span schema, codegen, and maybe some core logic) and provides an approval or minor suggestions. Finally, changes are merged. Throughout, the Architect agent might have provided guidance at the start (“Ensure this fits the data model constraints and doesn’t break existing apps; consider backward compatibility.”).

By simulating this process, you offload a lot of mental load to the agents. They become your pair programmers and reviewers. This is exactly what multi-agent coding research is exploring – for instance, the ChatDev project showed that multiple agents can develop software together through a series of “seminars” (design, coding, testing, documenting) ￼. Your setup is a custom realization of that with your MDC roles as the knowledge base for each agent.

One thing to watch is context length – code diffs or files can be long. Tools like function calling (where the agent can ask for a file content and you provide it out-of-band) may be needed. You can implement a tool like get_file(path, start_line, end_line) that the agent can call to retrieve specific file sections on demand, rather than stuffing the entire file in the prompt. This way, even a 7B model with limited context can work on a large codebase by fetching parts as needed.

Workflow 4: Conversational App Builder (EDNET DSL to Flutter)

This workflow is about creating a conversational interface for app development using your EDNET DSL (ednet.yaml). Essentially, a user (developer or not) should be able to describe an app in natural language, and the system will produce the EDNET DSL specification, validate it, generate the Flutter code, and possibly assist in building/deploying the app – all through conversation.

To implement this, you can use an agent that combines a dialogue skill with tool-use for code generation. The structure might involve one primary agent (let’s call it the AppBuilder Agent) that interacts with the user and coordinates sub-tasks, or a pair of agents (one as the “translator” and one as a “validator/coder”). A plausible design:
	•	The user says: “I want a simple app where users can post photos and comment on them, with a home feed and a profile page.”
	•	AppBuilder Agent (which could be built with AutoGen for rich conversation or with a sequence in CrewAI) will parse this request. Its first job is to draft an ednet.yaml that represents the app. This requires understanding the EDNET DSL syntax and the schema of valid YAML (you have schema.json for it). The agent might reply to the user to clarify requirements if needed (just like a human would ask follow-up questions). For example, the agent might ask: “Do you want user authentication in this app?” – to refine the specification.
	•	Once the agent has enough info, it produces an initial EDNET YAML. You should definitely use the schema.json to validate it. You can integrate a JSON Schema validator tool (there are Python libraries like jsonschema that can validate YAML/JSON against a schema). The AppBuilder agent can call a validate_yaml(yaml_text) tool which returns any schema errors. If there are errors, the agent knows to fix the YAML (perhaps it says to the user “Oops, I need to adjust the app config for correctness.” or just silently fixes and validates again). Ensuring the DSL is valid is crucial before codegen.
	•	After validation passes, the agent triggers the Code Generation. This could be done via a tool call, e.g., generate_code(yaml_path) which runs the ednet_code_generator on the YAML and outputs a Flutter project (or Dart code). If ednet_code_generator is available as a library or CLI, you can call it directly. The agent doesn’t write the Flutter code itself (that’s what the generator is for), which is good for consistency. The generator will produce the codebase (Dart files, etc.).
	•	Once code is generated, you can have the agent do a build/test cycle. It can run flutter pub get and flutter analyze to ensure no analysis issues, and even flutter test if your generator produces tests or you have some default tests. If any errors arise (e.g., a widget not defined due to an unimplemented feature in generator, or schema allowed something generator doesn’t handle), the agent can catch that. This might require parsing compiler output. For example, if flutter analyze says “error: Unknown widget X”, the agent realizes the DSL included a component that the generator doesn’t support. The agent could either try to adjust the DSL (maybe remove or replace that part) or inform the user of limitations (“The current code generator can’t produce that component. You might need custom coding.”). This is an advanced step, but it would make the system robust.
	•	If the build succeeds, the agent can inform the user that the app has been generated successfully. The conversation can continue with the user requesting changes: “Great, can we also add a like button to posts?” The agent would update the DSL (maybe it had a model Post and now adds a field likes and a button in the UI spec), re-run validation, regen code for the affected parts, and so on. This iterative loop continues until the user is satisfied.
	•	For CI/CD and publishing: This depends on how far you want to automate. The agent could help with publishing by integrating with tools like fastlane or by pushing the code to a repo where a CI/CD pipeline builds it. For example, a tool publish_app(platform) might trigger a script to build an APK or submit to TestFlight. If you have something set up (like a GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push to a release branch), the agent could simply push the generated code to that branch to initiate the pipeline. Or it could run local build commands and output an artifact path for the user (“Your APK is ready at build/app/outputs/…apk”). A truly autonomous publishing agent would need sensitive credentials (store keys for app stores), so you might keep that manual for now. But the agent can guide the user: “Run flutter build ipa and upload to TestFlight” or similar instructions if full automation is risky.

Using AutoGen for this workflow is appealing because it is fundamentally a conversation between a human and an agent, possibly with the agent enlisting help from sub-agents (like a “Validator” agent). AutoGen supports having a user proxy agent (representing the user) and a tool agent talk. In a simple setup, though, you might not need multiple AI agents – one agent that can call functions (validate, generate, etc.) is enough. If using something like LangChain or OpenAI function calling: you could implement this as well – design a single chain where the LLM receives user messages and can invoke tools (functions) for “validate_yaml” and “generate_code”. In either case, the architecture is an Agent + Tools pattern rather than multiple agents arguing. The conversation with the user provides requirements; the tools turn those requirements into working code.

To ensure correctness, incorporate the schema deeply: perhaps even include some of its rules in the prompt (to guide the agent’s YAML generation). The schema validation tool will catch errors, but if the agent is aware of the schema (or you fine-tune it on examples of ednet.yaml), it will make fewer mistakes.

Extensibility: Over time, you might add more capabilities: e.g., a Library Advisor Agent that suggests existing open-source packages to integrate based on the app description (“you might use firebase_auth for the auth feature”). Or an agent that does UI preview (perhaps describing how the UI would look in text, or even generating a simple graphical preview if connected to a renderer). These could become part of this workflow as separate agents that the main AppBuilder agent consults. For now, focus on the core loop: Spec -> Code -> Build.

User experience: Likely you will implement this as a chat interface (maybe a terminal chat or a web app) where the user messages go to the agent and it replies. You can back the agent with Qwen-2.5 32B or DeepSeek for its strong reasoning, but be mindful: code models are good at code but might not be as fluent in interactive dialogue as a chat-tuned model. Qwen2.5-Coder is an instruct code model; it should handle this, but you might consider a variant or instruct it clearly to speak in a helpful manner. Since it will be outputting YAML text at times, ensure it encloses it in markdown triple backticks or something so it’s clear. The agent should also explain what it’s doing (“I’m generating the app specification…”, “Code generated, now building the app…”) to keep the user engaged and informed.

Integration with the monorepo: The generated app could be placed in a subdirectory of your monorepo or a separate repo. The agent could automatically commit the generated code to a new repo, etc. That way, after conversation, the user can pull the code and run it. If using a local machine, the agent can just tell the user where the code is.

In summary, the conversational app builder is a specialized agent that combines natural language understanding, strict schema-based generation, and tool use for codegen & build. It turns the DSL and codegen system you built into a user-friendly AI pair programmer. This could be a highlight feature of EDNET (allowing non-programmers to create digital democracy tools by conversation).

Running Locally with Open-Source Models and Infrastructure

You have a high-end Apple Silicon (M2 Max, 64GB RAM), which is excellent for running large models locally. To implement the above:
	•	Model Setup: Use Ollama or similar to serve your models. Ollama can run Qwen-2.5-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, etc., and provides an API for queries. CrewAI explicitly supports connecting to Ollama-hosted models ￼, so you can configure it such that each agent’s LLM calls go to http://localhost:11434 (for example) with the model name. This means no internet or cloud is required for the AI itself, aligning with your open-source requirement. Qwen-2.5 32B is heavy but should run with 64GB (perhaps with 4-bit quantization). You might also try DeepSeek-Coder which might be smaller or more efficient for code. Some users report Qwen2.5 is powerful but can hallucinate, whereas DeepSeek might be more reliable in some coding tasks ￼ – you may experiment to see which fits your needs. You could even designate different models per agent role: e.g., use the coding-optimized model for Developer and QA agents (for better code generation and analysis), but use a more general LLM (maybe a fine-tuned Llama-2 chat) for the Strategy or Marketing agent (better at language and reasoning). CrewAI and AutoGen allow you to specify model per agent instance.
	•	Performance: Running multiple agents will put load on the models. If using one model for all, the calls will be sequential anyway unless you specifically parallelize. With one 32B model, you might handle one agent at a time reasonably. If you want multiple truly parallel (e.g., Dev and UX working simultaneously), you’d need either multiple instances of the model or a smaller model for one of them. It might be simpler to orchestrate them in sequence to avoid concurrency issues with the GPU/CPU usage. Use streaming outputs if possible so you can see partial results (helps in debugging long responses).
	•	Memory and context: Try to keep prompts concise by providing relevant context. Because everything is local, you have flexibility in reading files, searching, etc. You might implement a simple caching of agent responses or a vector DB for long-term memory so the agents don’t repeatedly analyze the same code. For example, a memory store where the Architect agent remembers past design decisions (“We decided on MVC for the CMS last month”) so it doesn’t need to rediscover that.
	•	Orchestration code: You’ll be writing the “glue code” to tie this together. If using CrewAI, you will write Python scripts that define the agents, their roles (system prompts), the tools (functions) they can use, and then launch tasks. CrewAI provides abstractions to run a crew either to completion or step-by-step. It also has some logging/observability. You might utilize its Crew Control Plane for monitoring if you want a UI for traces ￼, though that might not be necessary for local dev. AutoGen, if used, will require you to set up the conversation flows – there are examples in their repo for a user + assistant + tools conversation.
	•	Extensibility & Maintenance: Treat this whole setup as part of your monorepo tooling. Perhaps create a directory agents/ with configuration (your YAMLs, prompt templates) and code (Python scripts for orchestration). Document how to run each workflow’s agent (maybe a CLI command for each, e.g., python agents/ngo_flow.py). This will allow iterative improvement. You’ll likely refine prompts, add new tools, or upgrade models over time. Because everything is local and open, you have full control – no hitting OpenAI rate limits or data issues.
	•	References & Inspiration: For further guidance, you might look at:
	•	ChatDev (OpenBMB) ￼ – the multi-agent software dev framework (they have a visualizer too) for ideas on workflow.
	•	CrewAI documentation and examples – e.g., the CrewAI blog’s example of an automated vacation planner with agents ￼ (though a different domain, it shows how tasks can be split among agents).
	•	Microsoft’s Magentic-One paper (built on AutoGen) which describes a generalist multi-agent system solving complex tasks ￼ – could have insights on scaling your system.
	•	Langfuse or other monitoring tools in case you want to log agent interactions for debugging (optional, but could be useful since multi-agent can get complex; Langfuse is mentioned in context of tracking agent behavior across frameworks ￼).

By combining these frameworks, tools, and design patterns, you will effectively emulate a full-stack team with AI. Each workflow (NGO operations, product development, code maintenance, app building) will benefit from different configurations, but they can share the underlying infrastructure. For instance, the GitHub integration you implement can be reused by all workflows (grant writer could file an issue, dev agents commit code, etc.). Likewise, the local model serving can be shared.

This setup will allow a single user (you) to accomplish multi-faceted projects that typically require an entire team. You’ll have an army of specialized open-source AI agents at your command – working together through proper orchestration. With careful prompt design and tool integration, this can dramatically enhance your productivity while keeping everything running locally and securely.
