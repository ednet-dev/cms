# Guidelines and Best Practices for RFCs in the Form of GitHub PRs
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines and best practices for creating RFCs in the form of GitHub pull requests (PRs) to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency in the RFC process.

## Purpose of RFCs
RFCs, or "Request for Comments," are documents that propose a significant change or addition to a project. RFCs provide an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss and debate a proposed change before it is implemented. RFCs are an essential part of the open-source community and ensure that decisions are made in a transparent and collaborative way.

## RFC Process
The RFC process typically consists of the following steps:

1. **Proposal**: The author creates an RFC in the form of a GitHub pull request, which outlines the proposed change or addition.
2. **Discussion**: The community reviews and discusses the RFC, providing feedback, suggestions, and concerns.
3. **Revision**: The author revises the RFC based on the community's feedback.
4. **Final Review**: The community reviews the revised RFC, ensuring that all feedback has been addressed.
5. **Merge**: The RFC is merged into the project, and the proposed change or addition is implemented.

## Guidelines for Creating an RFC
When creating an RFC in the form of a GitHub PR, follow these guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency:

1. **Title**: The title of the RFC should be concise and descriptive of the proposed change or addition.
2. **Description**: The description should provide a detailed explanation of the proposed change or addition, including the motivation behind it, its benefits, and potential drawbacks.
3. **Scope**: The RFC should clearly define the scope of the proposed change or addition, including any limitations or exclusions.
4. **Alternatives**: The RFC should discuss any alternative approaches that were considered and explain why they were not chosen.
5. **Compatibility**: The RFC should discuss any compatibility issues that may arise from the proposed change or addition.
6. **Examples**: The RFC should include examples or use cases that demonstrate how the proposed change or addition would work in practice.
7. **Implementation**: The RFC should provide a high-level overview of how the proposed change or addition would be implemented, including any dependencies or technical considerations.
8. **Collaboration**: The RFC should encourage collaboration and feedback from the community.

## Best Practices for the RFC Process
When participating in the RFC process, follow these best practices to ensure efficiency and effectiveness:

1. **Be Constructive**: Provide constructive feedback and suggestions that are focused on improving the proposed change or addition.
2. **Be Respectful**: Respect the opinions and perspectives of other community members, even if you disagree with them.
3. **Be Timely**: Provide feedback in a timely manner to ensure that the RFC process is efficient and moves forward.
4. **Be Specific**: Be specific when providing feedback, citing examples and providing concrete suggestions for improvement.
5. **Be Collaborative**: Work collaboratively with the author and other community members to ensure that the RFC is the best it can be.

Following these guidelines and best practices for creating RFCs in the form of GitHub pull requests will help ensure a clear, consistent, and efficient RFC process that benefits the entire community.
