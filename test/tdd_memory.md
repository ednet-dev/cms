# TDD Memory - Ednet Core Library

## Context Summary
- This is a Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation for the `ednet_core` library
- Located in `/Users/slavisam/projects/cms/packages/core`
- Current focus: Domain Modeling components
- Recent progress: Completed basic Model, Concept, and Attribute testing
- Next focus: Attribute validation and type handling

## AI Assistant Role
- Implement TDD approach for the `ednet_core` library
- Create and maintain test files following TDD principles
- Track progress and plan next steps in this memory file
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Follow RGR (Red-Green-Refactor) cycle
- Document test cases clearly
- Maintain test isolation

## Completed Tests
1. Model Testing - Basic Initialization (✓)
   - Empty concepts initialization
   - Domain and code assignment
   - Policy components initialization
   - Domain models registration

2. Concept Testing - Basic Functionality (✓)
   - Default values
   - Model association
   - Entry concept handling
   - Parent-child relationships

3. Attribute Testing - Basic Functionality (✓)
   - Default values
   - Type handling
   - Required attributes
   - Identifier attributes
   - Derived attributes
   - Initialization values
   - Increment attributes

## Next Steps
1. Implement Attribute validation tests:
   - Type validation
   - Required value validation
   - Length validation
   - Update validation
   - Policy integration

## Notes
- Focus on one component at a time
- Follow RGR (Red-Green-Refactor) cycle
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Document test cases clearly
- Maintain test isolation
