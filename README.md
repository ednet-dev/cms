# EDNet.dev
CMS implementation in Dart and Flutter

# Content
## Principles
- **Human biology**: the human biology influences the sensory apparatus and therefore the types of content that can be consumed. This should be taken into account when defining the content types in the system.

- **Human psychology**: The cognitive abilities and psychology of humans should also be considered when designing the content management system. For example, the way information is presented and the layout of the user interface should be designed in a way that is easy for users to understand and navigate.

- **Digital product limitations**: The limitations of a digital product should also be considered when designing the content management system. For example, the types of media that can be handled by the system and the way that the content is stored and retrieved.
