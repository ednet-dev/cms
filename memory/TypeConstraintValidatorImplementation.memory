# Type Constraint Validator E2E Implementation Memory

## Overview
This memory file tracks the implementation of the TypeConstraintValidator feature across the EDNet ecosystem, following a systematic TDD approach.

## Core Implementation Status ‚úÖ
- Created `TypeConstraintValidator` class with support for:
  - Numeric range validation (min/max)
  - String validation (min/max length, patterns)
  - Email and URL format validation
  - Detailed error messages
- Enhanced `AttributeType` with constraint capabilities
- Created comprehensive test suite
- All tests passing

## Integration Plan
We're following these steps for complete E2E integration:

1. ‚úÖ Address analyzer issues and ensure code quality
   - ‚úÖ Improved code formatting for consistency
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced documentation for public methods and classes
   - ‚úÖ Added usage examples
   - ‚úÖ All tests passing
   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Individual file analyzer warnings are expected due to 'part of' relationship

2. ‚úÖ Flutter Form Validation Integration
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced `ConstraintValidatorAdapter` to properly use the core type validation
   - ‚úÖ Added detailed error handling and messages from core validators
   - ‚úÖ Improved `ConstraintValidatedForm` with validation-on-change support
   - ‚úÖ Added constraint visualization indicators in form fields
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced example application to demonstrate constraint capabilities

3. ‚úÖ E Schema Definition Integration
      - ‚úÖ E- Extend YAML/JSON domain models to support constraints
      - ‚úÖ E- Update bootstrapping code to load constraints from schema

4. üîÑ UI Components for CMS
   - ‚úÖ Created prototype for master-detail navigation pattern to expose domain model
   - ‚úÖ Designed hierarchical navigation flow with progressive disclosure
   - ‚úÖ Integrated constraint validated form into the entity detail view
   - ‚¨ú Fix type mismatches with actual ednet_core classes
   - ‚¨ú Implement proper relationship traversal logic
   - ‚¨ú Connect to actual constraint validation system
   - ‚¨ú Create working demo with sample data

5. ‚¨ú Code Generation
   - Update code generators to incorporate constraints
   - Generate validation logic in model classes

6. ‚¨ú Validation UI Feedback
   - Display validation errors in the UI
   - Provide meaningful error messages

7. ‚¨ú Documentation & Examples
   - Update documentation with constraint examples
   - Add tutorials for constraint usage

8. ‚¨ú End-to-End Testing
   - Create comprehensive E2E tests
   - Verify constraints work across the stack

## Current Status
Implemented a prototype for master-detail navigation pattern in the shell app. Created the UI components for navigating the domain model and integrating with constraint validation. Need to update the prototype to match actual classes in ednet_core.

Next: Analyze domain model implementation in ednet_core to align our prototype with the actual class structure.
