# EDNet Visualization Refactoring Memory File

## Context Summary
We're refactoring the EDNet visualization framework to create a unified, high-performance solution that addresses current issues in the codebase. The goal is to create a Miro/Lucid-level experience for domain model editing with premium UX features and consistent behavior.

## Current Status
- Implemented core geometric algorithms needed for optimization
- Created a unified visualization canvas component
- Enhanced quadtree with nearest-neighbor and range search capabilities
- Implemented bin packing for label placement
- Optimized force-directed layout with Barnes-Hut approximation
- Enhanced selection handling with nearest-neighbor search

## Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Unify Visualization Components

2. **Deprecate GraphApplication**
   - Ensure GraphPage fully replaces GraphApplication functionality

   - Add zoom controls (buttons for zoom in/out, reset view)
   - Support pinch-to-zoom and momentum scrolling

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization

4. **Implement Visibility Culling**
   - Only render nodes visible in the current viewport

6. **Enhance Layout Algorithms**
   - Finalize Barnes-Hut optimized force-directed layout
   - Implement additional layout options (hierarchical, circular, etc.)
   - Add user controls to switch between layout algorithms

### Phase 3: UX Enhancements

7. **Improve Selection and Interaction**
   - Implement "magnetic" selection using nearest-neighbor search
   - Add multi-select capabilities
   - Implement context menus for entities
   - Add hover effects and tooltips

8. **Add Animation Effects**
   - Implement smooth transitions between states
   - Add enter/exit animations for entities
   - Create feedback animations for user interactions
   - Ensure animations are performant on large graphs

9. **Enhance Label Placement**
   - Implement smart label positioning to avoid overlaps
   - Add priority-based placement for important entities
   - Support different label styles and sizes
   - Implement label collision avoidance

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

10. **Integrate with Existing Application Flow**
    - Ensure the visualization works within the existing app navigation
    - Update routes and navigation to support the new visualization
    - Add feature flags for gradual rollout

11. **Comprehensive Testing**

## Day 1 Milestone Summary
We've successfully refactored the GraphPage to use our new UnifiedVisualizationCanvas component and deprecated the old GraphApplication implementation with appropriate migration notices. 

The new implementation leverages:
