# EDNet Visualization Refactoring Memory File

## Context Summary
We're refactoring the EDNet visualization framework to create a unified, high-performance solution that addresses current issues in the codebase. The goal is to create a Miro/Lucid-level experience for domain model editing with premium UX features and consistent behavior.

## Current Status
- Implemented core geometric algorithms needed for optimization
- Created a unified visualization canvas component
- Enhanced quadtree with nearest-neighbor and range search capabilities
- Implemented bin packing for label placement
- Optimized force-directed layout with Barnes-Hut approximation
- Enhanced selection handling with nearest-neighbor search

## Architectural Progress

### Implemented Features

   - Created `EnhancedQuadtree` implementation with nearest-neighbor search
   - Added range search capabilities for visibility culling
   - Implemented utilities for spatial querying

2. **Layout Algorithms**
   - Implemented `OptimizedForceDirectedLayout` with Barnes-Hut approximation
   - Added entity metadata support for smarter layout decisions
   - Implemented adaptive convergence for better performance

3. **Interaction Enhancements**
   - Added `EnhancedSelectionHandler` with nearest-neighbor support
   - Implemented hover detection for better UX
   - Added animation support for selection feedback

4. **Label Placement Optimization**
   - Implemented bin packing algorithm for label placement
   - Created priority-based placement strategy
   - Implemented collision avoidance for labels

5. **Unified Canvas**
   - Created `UnifiedVisualizationCanvas` component
   - Implemented consistent rendering pipeline
   - Added support for visual decorators
   - Integrated all optimization algorithms

### Algorithmic Integration

#### Nearest-Neighbor Search (20.5)
- Implemented in `EnhancedQuadtree` with optimized recursive search
- Used in `EnhancedSelectionHandler` for smart selection
- Provides significantly better user experience with "magnetic" selection

#### Range Search (20.6)
- Added to `EnhancedQuadtree` for efficient spatial queries
- Used in `UnifiedVisualizationCanvas` for visibility culling
- Enables rendering only what's visible, improving performance

#### Force-Directed Layout (20.14)
- Enhanced with Barnes-Hut approximation for O(n log n) instead of O(nÂ²)
- Added adaptive convergence for faster stabilization
- Implemented relationship strength influence on layout

#### Quadtree/Spatial Partitioning
- Core spatial indexing structure for multiple operations
- Provides foundation for nearest-neighbor and range queries
- Used for collision detection and efficient rendering

#### Bin Packing (20.9)
- Implemented rectlinear bin packing for label placement
- Added priority-based placement for important labels
- Ensures readable labels even in dense visualizations
