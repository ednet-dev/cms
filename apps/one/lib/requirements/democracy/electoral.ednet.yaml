  name: Government
  description: |
    Government represents the governing body of a country or state. 
    It is responsible for making and enforcing laws, managing public resources,
    and providing public services. The government is typically divided into three branches:
    the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. 
    Each branch has its own responsibilities and powers, 
    and they work together to ensure the smooth functioning 
    of the government and the country as a whole.

domain:
  name: Executive
  description: |
    The executive branch of government is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws 
    passed by the legislative branch. It is headed by the president or prime minister, 
    who is the head of state and government. The executive branch also includes 
    the cabinet and various government agencies that are responsible for specific areas 
    such as defense, finance, and health. The executive branch is responsible for 
    managing the day-to-day operations of the government and ensuring that the laws 
    passed by the legislative branch are carried out.

model:
  name: Electoral
  description: |
    The electoral model represents the process of electing representatives to government positions. 
    It includes concepts such as citizens, voters, candidates, elections, and election types. 
    The electoral model defines the rules and procedures for conducting elections, 
    registering voters, and counting votes. It also includes policies and commands 
    related to verifying the identity of voters and candidates, creating new elections, 
    and handling election results.
    Additionally, the model is designed to be flexible enough to handle various scales 
    and types of democratic decision-making processes, from national elections to 
    local councils, NGO projects, and even household decision-making.
